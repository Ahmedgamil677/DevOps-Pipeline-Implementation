#Azure DevOps Pipeline Documentation#

##Overview
This project implements a complete DevOps pipeline on Azure with CI/CD, automated testing, Infrastructure as Code, and safe deployment strategies.

##Pipeline Architecture ##

###CI Pipeline##
- Triggered on commits to main/develop branches
- Builds .NET 6 application
- Runs unit tests with code coverage
- Publishes build artifacts

###CD Pipeline###
- Multi-stage deployment (Dev → Staging → Production)
- Infrastructure provisioning via ARM templates
- Blue-green deployments with staging slots
- Manual approval gates for production
- Integration testing in the dev environment

##Safe Deployment Strategies##

1. **Blue-Green Deployments**: Using staging slots for zero-downtime deployments
2. **Manual Approval Gates**: Required for production deployments
3. **Integration Testing**: Automated tests in dev environment
4. **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring
5. **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback on failures

##Setup Instructions##

### Prerequisites###
- Azure DevOps organization
- Azure subscription
- .NET 6 SDK

###Configuration Steps###

1. **Create Azure Service Connections**
   - Navigate to Project Settings → Service Connections
   - Create Azure Resource Manager connections for dev, staging, prod

2. **Create Variable Groups**
   - Create `dev-environment`, `staging-environment`, `prod-environment` variable groups
   - Add variables: `subscription-id-{env}`, `appName`

3. **Import Pipelines**
   - Import `ci-pipeline.yml` and `cd-pipeline.yml`
   - Configure triggers and branch policies

4. **Initial Deployment**
   - Push code to the develop branch to trigger dev deployment
   - Merge to main for staging/production deployment

##Monitoring and Feedback##

- Azure Application Insights for application monitoring
- Pipeline analytics in Azure DevOps
- Test results and code coverage reports
- Deployment status notifications

##Troubleshooting##

Common issues and solutions:
- ARM template deployment failures: Check resource naming conventions
- Test failures: Verify test environment configuration
- Deployment timeouts: Adjust timeout settings in pipelines
